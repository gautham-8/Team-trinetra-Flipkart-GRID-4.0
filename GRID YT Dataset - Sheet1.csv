I love how Marques does no gimmicks and just talks. His analysis and cool voice is enough here - no need for fancy stuff.,0
This man's cinematography is on another level and still amazes me every video! Keep up this quality content!,0
High refresh rate mid rangers and budget phones are fantastic. I love how almost all new phones have high refresh rate now.,1
One of the honest tech reviewer !! Well done üëçüèº,0
"love the detail that there is nothing on/in the set, really appreciate the effort there. Thats one reason why your vids are top notch and unique. Thanks a lot man.",0
"Dude, I love your imagination and sense of humor. üòÇ (No more ""Nothing"" puns while the entire set is completely featureless)",0
Wireless charging and ois are very rare traits for this price range. It will most likely be worth the money.,1
Their UI and overall specs for that price is quite descent. Pretty impressive.,1
"Nothing might be the reason I finally switch back to Android. These designs are incredibly clean, though the lights are a tiny bit gimmicky.",1
He kept his promise. He could have easily said - here goes nothing- üòÖ,0
"Well-done as any tech reviewer you have done great job reviewing the product really liked it and you and some help from the sponsor made everything clear to the audiance by "" something"" without hearting feeling of any of the audiance and ""nothing"" indirectly  üòÇüëçüèª",0
"Really respect your honest review, I believe you are the only youtuber who actually said glyp light adds nothing and it's so true. Other reviewers are marketing it like crazy, it does not add any value",0
"Finally one reviewer didn't give it the hype it doesn't deserve. Thanks Arun, for being honest!",0
"Love the honest review, Arun! No bullshit and straight to the point, cheers!üçª",0
This is actually really interesting. From the nothing ear buds and now a phone. The led is pretty flashy but kinda cool too.,1
Amazing stuff by this phone. I hope they stick around long enough!,1
"If they continue making really good phones whilst making them unique ,I think we‚Äôve got a winner here",1
"I love this phone, the great (iPhone-like) design, great screen, and the optimized software with near-stock Android. ",1
"Always enjoy concrete, nuanced reviews like yours. Thanks a lot for this!",0
"I honestly love this phone it's more my price range, it's a hell of a looker as far as a phone goes, I'd be proud to use one everyday.",1
"Your style of reviews are second to none!! 
Very captivating and actually makes me want to know more. Love your videosü§ù",0
"The camera actually surprised me, it looks very similar to the Iphone!",1
I feel this can be the first Android that focuses on quality of phone usage like iPhone rather than unlimited amount of specs but compromising on quality like the other androids.,1
"And that's why I just love your reviews, true & crisp. Thanks a ton. It really helped figuring out which one is my next phone.",0
Love the design and lights. Only concern is the cameras. Can you use gcam on it?,1
I think this phone should have a higher quality side (like a pro) that is maybe in a 500-600 dollar price range .,1
"Impressive specs, considering its price point",1
This phone actually seems like a pretty good phone.,1
Great video as always Arun,0
Probably the only YouTuber whose videos I don't skip cause of how well it is done! Amazing information and animations throughout the video and it keeps you engaged!!,0
Awesome work Arun!!,0
"From a price to performance ratio perspective, the nothing phone is actually really good",1
Youre always the most honest reviewer.,0
Surprised to see the level of research and depth of the comparison.  Good work!,0
Being part of the Apple design team has to be the easiest job ever..,0
"Small upgrades, massive price tag! Gonna give this one a miss and see what they bring out next year",1
Apple is so good at marketing and people are so hooked on their products to a point where they'd buy anything Apple releases. That's crazy!,1
"Cinematic mode, ProMotion 120 Hz and ProRes Video are things that I want to try and see if they make a difference!! Anyways, you gave a quite bit of insights to iPhone 13 with these rendered models... thanks for updating us with an unbiased opinion...",1
Definitely would go with an iPhone 13 for the compact size and the functionality with the iPhone 13,1
This is the most amazing iPhone yet! Definitely can't wait for the new one next year! Good job apple. R&D mustve cost billions with all of these new and original innovations.,1
"So I've actually never had one but its beautiful, the 13 pro max is my absolute favorite. Great video.üëçüëçüëçüëç",1
This Unboxing sounds are so so satisfying ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è love it,0
The background... the light.. the fading the floor everything... Perfection!,0
That purple colour on the iphone is just gorge. I thought that the dark green from previous versions was already to die for but when i saw that periwinckle purple i died and went to heaven. Its beautiful,1
"I‚Äôve always been an Xbox fanboy, but I will say that I completely respect and admire Sony for everything they‚Äôve contributed to gaming in general. The PS5 looks like an awesome system. I absolutely love my series X, which is amazing with my elite 2, but I have no ill will towards PS fans. In fact, I want to say congratulations on getting y‚Äôall‚Äôs hands on a PS5, and I truly hope y‚Äôall are enjoying it! Love from Ohio",1
I just love how all of a sudden PS and XBox switched their base colour,1
"I'm far from being a tech guy kind of person, but, it is refreshing to see that both companies/consoles are trying to outdo the other, with better offerings for the consumer to look upon, ""competition thrives or yields quality products"", great comparative review by the way @Unbox Therapy",0
something about symmetrical bezels makes a phone look so much nicer,1
"6.1"" is perfect, hate the trend of huge screens",1
Received my Green S22+ yesterday. I'm trading in my S20+. I'm really loving it so far. Everything is really snappy and smooth. I'm glad they went back to a flat screen so you can put on a tempered glass screen protector that fits properly.,1
"After having a disappointing experience with the Pixel 6, the S22+ seems like the way to go.",1
"We need these types of leaps of technology and balances in the smart phone world, I have to give a hats off to Asus for keeping Competition Alive and well.",1
Big car guy and tech enthusiast and I LOVE the car analogies! They fit so well and make so much sense! ,1

I‚Äôd like to see this much effort put into their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù flagships. Hopefully the new ZenFone 9 is good.,1
With every review he reminds you why you subscribed in the 1st place. I absolutely love the determination and consistency.,0
I appreciate the work you put into these videos. As someone who just started YouTube you are a motivation to me! Thnx for everything.,0
"As always, well delivered MKBHD!! Best tech advisor ever!!",0
MKBHD: gets the fastest phone on the planet,0
also him: plays among us on it,0
That opening camera sweep from behind the laptop to above the keyboard and then zomming in to draw the M2 on the keys was brilliant! Nice work!,1
"I'm curious if Apple would ever decide to create a Macbook SE. Maybe keep the Macbook Air M1 design in principle but tweak it in a way that they could sell it for... I dunno $699 or less and have it start competing with Chromebooks and the like (or at least the peception of a super cheap, gateway product into Mac OS).",1
I love how MKBHD just jumps right into the video and doesn't waste our time. Also very informative! Thanks for this video!,0
Excellent review. The best I have seen since the new MacBook Air M2 came out. The fact this little laptop could render videos shows it can handle day-to-day workflows. I have a version spec'ed out and I am looking forward to its delivery.  Yes it was little pricey and I normally buy MacBook Pro's but when I look at how I use laptops I think this hits a sweet spot for me.,1
"After reading all of the responsible reviews, it‚Äôs clear that the ability to render video (as an example) is mostly for occasional convenience. The fact that you can do some 4K rendering is just amazing. Trying to compare this M2 MBA to an active cool system is for stunt purposes only. Otherwise, this might be the best ultra portable ever.",1
I was considering buying for traveling mostly because my 16‚Äù is not travel material in my opinion. It‚Äôs heavy! But at the same time I feel you when you say Apple should started with at least 512gb ssd and more memory without going so high up with the price.  And I wish there was a full white one including the keyboard!,1
Always so happy when Marques drops a review on something I have been waiting a long time for. Never fails to impress with the quality of the video!,0
"Absolutely killing it with the intros. They are so original, so good, and literally increase the already EXTREMELY HIGH quality videos by an absolute TON. Keep it up man!",0
"The fact that Apple not only decided to stick with 256GB as the entry storage, but is in fact SLOWER storage than the previous model is absurd. It should at the very least have a note on their website specifying these detail",1
The use of colour in this was so so good! Just watching your  video compositions go from brilliance to brilliance is so exciting,0
"I‚Äôve been using my M1 AIR 16GB and 500gb for 3 months now and I still love it and have had no problems with it, people told me I should wait and buy the new M2 but this has done me just well and it was a lot cheaper than the m2",1
It is definitely such a great design ,1
Absolutely love my Macbook Air M1 and can't wait to get this one!,1
"ok , so mac book air M2, compaired to a m1 pro or ultra would you say bang for buck . or even go for m1 mac book pro instead of M2 air. I think from your review this is what we need to know.",1
Love your reviews dude! You are so good at breaking it down and speaking the average consumers language. Gonna snag this for sure. Be blessed!,0
"Very concise review, and your studio looks great!  I cant wait for my midnight air tomorrow.",1
I would love to see the black/blue come to the macbook pro lineup. I'd buy a maxed out ultra in this black color.,1
"OMG!!! Your channel is awesome!!! I discovered it while watching M2 MacBook Air reviews and since then, I‚Äôve subscribed to it watched a huge amount of your videos.",0
"I can't believe this guy does a whole review on a laptop in 5 minutes, while others make a 20-minute video just for first impressions.",0
"Holy shit. You were not kidding, The equivalent NVIDIA laptop for the same laptop is $500 dollars more right now, what a fantastic purchase opportunity for consumers and a real marketing component for innovation, having great performance and temps while at the same time not sacrificing temperatures or battery life of the system. I really wish that they would push the amd advantage onto non gaming laptops like the XPS, as I would love to see what these products can offer from a productivity laptop perspective, as the numbers here seem to be able to unironically be able to compete with apple M1 solution.",1
"I like this style of video. No fancy graphics or edits, it's like having a knowledgable friend chatting with you casually about the latest tech.",0
"In terms of upload frequency, Dave is on fire these days",0
I rly hope they continue their partnership I see it bearing fruits in the longer term.,0
"If you're considering one of these, I highly recommend looking into the Asus flow x13 as well. The Asus is (usually) actually in stock at best buy. You can get it w/ a ryzen 9 6000 hs series, 3050ti, also in a thin n light form factor, with a 120hz screen. It's also 360 degree flipable",1
I'm really interested in battery time and performance on battery. does it throttle down too much when not on power source?,1
"Thank god, the lighting is finally normal and not eye dazzling lol",0
I was surprised with the webcam quality üòçüòç,0
Me downloading a 4K wallpaper in my 480p screened üíª laptop is a joke right!,0
I hope Unbox Therapy Channel gets to 20 million this year,0
"Hi, how about case quality, heat, fan noise, battery life and performance.  this laptop or the new Xps 13 plus ??  , greets, kriszty",1
"Very concise review, and your studio looks great!  I cant wait for my midnight air tomorrow.",1
The bezels look good,1
Nice nice now make a review video on the Toyota Supra behind you üéå,0
The only problem with Lenovo are their hinges.. No matter which laptop you buy.. Be it a low end or top end.. Post 2 years those hinges are gonna be gone and you gotta pay a lot for replacement.. Which is sad.,1
"Your videos were interesting, i used to watch them, advise you to shorten the duration of lew later videos and here u got ur background mess and in addition, i really miss ur phone unboxing videos, n the last one, colorful ceiling üßê, sorry mate((",0
I didn't get a notification good thing I took a look thru my YouTube subscribers list..,0

I love how Marques is slowly shifting from analysing the products specs to analysing the companies predatory behavior.,0
